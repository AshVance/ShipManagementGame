// Ship game project:
This game is intended to be a sort of spaceship management game, where the player manages their ship as it encounters
various things in space (like hostile ships, asteroid fields, space stations, etc). It's the players job to manage things
like oxygen levels, replenish food and water and make sure their ship is in working order. 

Many other games such as Fallout and Elite Dangerous have inspired the creation of this project, and elements of their
games can be found as inspiration for features in this one.

This is a long-term project and as such this list is likely to grow large. This is for my (the developer) purposes only,
although it may also function as a basic history of each step of development.

Structure:
Basic main menu (more details on each section below)
	- Quit function
	- Save/loading
		- Make use of simple text files in a sub-folder for now.
		- Possibly include multiple save files at some point
	- Ability to load 'game menu'
		- Includes all basic features, exploring/checking of ship status
	- Statistics menu

Gameplay:
The game will follow a simple gameplay loop similar to moving around the map in the original top-down Fallout games,
or in other old RPGs like Dragon Quest, where the player randomly encounters events. This makes games more interesting and
risky, as the player won't know whether or not the next event will be beneficial or detrimental.

Saving & loading:
For now, I plan to use a simple system where the player's data is dumped into a text document and then read by the program
when loading. This will be implemented after the core gameplay loop has largely been done.

Statistics:
My hope is for the game to be be able to record statistics while the player plays, which will be stored in a nice human-
readable text file as well as readable in the game itself. Will also be implemented after the core gameplay loop has been
done.
